In-memory graph builds avoid periodic commits and persist once, while on-disk builds commit every 500 files.
Why: memory has no WAL contention, but periodic disk commits bound lock hold time and preserve reader progress.
How to apply: retain the destination-specific cadence when changing insert batching.
